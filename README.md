## Overview

Computer architecture plays a crucial role in defining and bridging the interface between hardware and software in a computer system. It serves as the foundation upon which both hardware and software components are designed and interact with each other. A study of computer architecture complements the study of programming language.

Computer architecture plays a crucial role in defining and bridging the interface between hardware and software in a computer system. It serves as the foundation upon which both hardware and software components are designed and interact with each other. A study of computer architecture complements the study of programming language and algorithm, compiler, and operating system on the software side of the interface, and the study of embedded system, FPGA and VLSI design on the hardware side of the interface.
